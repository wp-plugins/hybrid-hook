<h1>A guide to Hybrid Hook</h1>

<p class="first"><em>Hybrid Hook</em> is one of the reasons I created the <em>Hybrid</em> theme.  It's part of my vision of making the ultimate theme framework, something with more flexibility than any other theme.  It's about making life easier for you.</p>

<p class="second">This plugin adds an additional theme settings paged named <em>Hybrid Hook</em>.  You can use it to input custom <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>, JavaScript, and even shortcodes.  You don't have to dig into those theme files just to add a little extra content to your blog.  You can use this plugin to add content anywhere.</p>

<h2>How to install the plugin</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Uzip the <code>hybrid-hook.zip</code> folder.</li>
	<li>Upload the <code>hybrid-hook</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</li>
	<li>In your WordPress admin, head over to the <em>Plugins</em> section.</li>
	<li>Activate <em>Hybrid Hook</em>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to use the plugin</h2>

<p>Once you've activated the plugin, a new menu item labeled <em>Hybrid Hook</em> will be under your <em>Appearance/Themes</em> menu in your WordPress admin.  This item will only be shown to users with the <code>edit_themes</code> capability (the Administrator role in default WordPress installations).</p>

<p>On the <em>Hybrid Hook Settings</em> page, you'll be presented with several sections, which have been broken up into major groups.  Within each section, there'll be several options.  Each option represents an action hook in the Hybrid theme.  For each option, you'll have three settings:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Textarea:</strong>  This is where you input your custom code.  You can add <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>, JavaScript, and shortcodes here.</li>
	<li><strong>Priority:</strong>  This is when your code will be fired on the action hook.  It's useful for adding things before/after the default actions of fired by <em>Hybrid</em>.  Typically, it's best to just leave this at the default of <code>10</code>.</li>
	<li><strong>Execute <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>?:</strong>  If you added <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> code to your textarea, you need to select this option for the code to be executed.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's pretty much it.  Just remember that you're responsible for the code you add to your site.</p>

<h2>Plugin support</h2>

<p>I run a WordPress community called <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid">Theme Hybrid</a>, which is where I fully support all of my WordPress projects, including plugins.  You can sign up for an account to get plugin support for a small yearly fee ($25 <acronym title="United States Dollars">USD</acronym> at the time of writing).</p>

<p>I know.  I know.  You might not want to pay for support, but just consider it a donation to the project.  To continue making cool, <acronym title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym>-licensed plugins and having the time to support them, I must pay the bills.</p>
